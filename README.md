 .NET is a free, open-source, and cross-platform for building modern, scalable, and high-performance desktop, web, cloud, and mobile applications. The current version of .NET is .NET 5.0, which is the successor of .NET Core 3.1 and .NET Framework 4.6. Prior to .NET 5.0, .NET had two versions, .NET Framework, and .NET Core, but in this version, both have merged and now there is only version.   .NET is a single unified platform to build desktop, web, cloud, mobile, gaming, IoT, and AI apps. The .NET ecosystem has a single common library, runtime, language compilers, and tools.
